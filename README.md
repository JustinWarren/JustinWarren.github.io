My Weather App

Project summary:  For my app project, I decided to make a simple weather-focused application that allows users to access weather information from a given location using an API.  My goal was to focus on simplicity and to have a clean, easy-to-use format and design.  In the top right corner, users are given the option to click on a button to access weather-related facts.  The information is displayed using a modal.

For the main content section of the app, users have the ability to enter a US city into the search input.  After clicking the search button, information is generated from the Weatherstack API (https://weatherstack.com/).  There are three areas that are populated with information: Current City, Current Temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit), and Weather Description.  

Media queries have been used in order to work towards responsiveness on multiple screen sizes.

The main technologies used in this project were:  HTML, CSS, JQuery and an API (https://weatherstack.com/).  In addition to this, I used CSS Flexbox to format the header and footer areas.

Fonts used:  Roboto
Colors used: #f2f2f2(main content background), #00BBFF(light blue), #00A5FF(dark blue).
